# ðŸ”¥ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of forest fires in Europe (EFFIS, 2000â€“2024)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the burned area database from the EFFIS (European Forest Fire Information System) covering the years 2000 to 2024.
The main objective is to identify spatial and temporal patterns of forest fires in Europe by analyzing their frequency, seasonality, and location.
Clustering techniques are applied to detect recurrent fire-prone areas, and temporal trends are explored throughout the year.
